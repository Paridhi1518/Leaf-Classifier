# Leaf-Classifier
This project focuses on classifying different types of leaves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on preprocessed leaf image data to accurately identify species based on visual patterns.  The entire application was Dockerized to ensure consistent deployment across different environments.
